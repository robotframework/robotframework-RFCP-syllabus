# Chapter 3: Keyword Design, Variables, and Resource Files

This chapter introduces the essential components of Robot Framework: **Keywords**, **Variables**, and **Resource Files**. These building blocks allow users to create reusable, structured, and maintainable automation solutions. Understanding these concepts is critical for developing efficient automation in both testing and RPA contexts.


## Variables
Variables in Robot Framework are used to store values that can be referenced and reused throughout suites, test cases, tasks, and keywords.
They help manage dynamic data or centrally maintained data, reducing hardcoding in multiple locations and making automation flexible.

Variables can be created and assigned in various ways, such as:
- Definition in the `*** Variables ***` section. (see [`*** Variables ***` Section](#variables-section))
- Capturing return values from keywords. (see [Return values from keywords](#return-values-from-keywords))
- Inline assignment using the `VAR` statement. (see [`VAR` statement](#var-statement))
- As arguments passed to keywords. (see [Keyword Arguments](#keyword-arguments))
- (*) By the command line interface of Robot Framework.
- (*) By internal implementation of library keywords.
- (*) By importing variables from variable files.

(*) These methods are not part of this syllabus.

Robot Framework, implemented in Python, can work with any object stored in variables, and syntactically distinguishes three types of accessing variables:
- **Scalar Variables**: Store values as a single entity and are represented by the dollar-syntax `${variable_name}`.
- **List-Like Variables**: Store multiple values in a list-like structure. They are created using the at-syntax `@{list-variable_name}`.
- **Dictionary-Like Variables**: Store key-value pairs in a dictionary-like structure. They are created using the ampersand-syntax `&{dictionary-variable_name}`.

These three different syntactical handling methods allow the users to create and handle lists and dictionaries natively in Robot Framework.
However, these prefixes just define the access type to the variable, and the actual data stored in the variable can be of any type, including strings, numbers, lists, dictionaries, or even objects.

When creating variables, the different syntax is used to define the type of the variable, but when accessing the variable, the scalar variable syntax with dollar `$` as the prefix is used in most cases.
More details about list-like and dictionary-like variables can be found in the [Advanced Variables](Chapter_5_Exploring_Advanced_Constructs.md#advanced-variables) chapter.

Additionally to these variable types, Robot Framework also supports access to environment variables, which can be accessed using the syntax `%{ENV_VAR_NAME}` respectively.
<!-- TODO fix the link -->


### Variable Syntax

Variables in Robot Framework are defined by three attributes:
- **Prefix**: `$`, `@`, or `&` to define the access type to the variable. (`%` for environment variables)
- **Delimiter**: `{}` to enclose the variable name.
- **Variable Name**: The name of the variable, which can be any valid string.

In case these prefixes followed by a curly brace opening (`${`) should be used as characters in a string,
they must be escaped by a backslash like `\${` to be treated as text rather than a variable start.


### `*** Variables ***` Section

Variables can be defined in the `*** Variables ***` section
and used across the suite where they were defined, or
in case they are defined in a Resource File, in any file that has imported that Resource File.

This section is typically used to define constants or to initialize variables that may be re-assigned during execution and more globally used.

Variables created in this section:
- are not indented,
- can be followed by an optional equal sign (`=`) to improve readability,
- can be scalar, list-like, or dictionary-like variables,
- are separated from their following value(s) by multiple spaces,
- can be defined in multiple lines using the `...` syntax.

Because two or more spaces are used to separate elements in a row,
all values are stripped of leading and trailing spaces, identical to arguments of keyword calls (see [Calling imported Keywords](Chapter_2_Getting_Started.md#calling-imported-keywords)).

Variable values in Robot Framework can include other variables, and their values will be concatenated at runtime when the line is executed.
This means that when a variable is used within another variable's value, the final value is resolved by replacing the variables with their actual content during execution.

Variables defined in the `*** Variables ***` section are recommended to be named in uppercase to distinguish them from local variables defined in test cases or keywords.

#### Scalar Variable Definition


Example of creating scalar variables:
```robotframework
*** Variables ***
${NAME}       Robot Framework
${VERSION}    8.0
${TOOL}       ${NAME} | version: ${VERSION}
```

The variable `${TOOL}` will be resolved to `Robot Framework | version: 8.0` at runtime.

If the value of a scalar variable is long, you can split it into multiple lines to improve readability using the `...` syntax.
By default, the lines are concatenated with a space, but a custom separator, defined by lowercase `separator=` followed by the separator value (e.g., newline `separator=\n`), can be used.
Also, no separator, to join them into one string (`separator=`), is possible.
If the string `separator=` shall be used as the last part of the value,
it must be escaped by a backslash like `\separator=` to be treated as text rather than the separator definition.


Example:
```robotframework
*** Variables ***
${EXAMPLE}        This value is joined
...               together with a space.
${MULTILINE}      First line.
...               Second line.
...               separator=\n
${SEARCH_URL}     https://example.com/search
...               ?query=robot+framework
...               &page=1
...               &filter=recent
...               &lang=en
...               &category=test-automation
...               separator=
```

`${SEARCH_URL}` will contain `https://example.com/search?query=robot+framework&page=1&filter=recent&lang=en&category=test-automation`.

#### List Variable Definition

List variables store multiple values and are defined using the at-syntax `@{variable_name}`.
You can define as many values as needed, with each additional value
separated by multiple spaces or line continuation using the `...` syntax.

Example:
```robotframework
*** Variables ***
@{NAMES}        Matti       Teppo
@{EMPTY_LIST}
@{NUMBERS}      one         two      three
...             four        five     six
```

Single values of list-like variables can be accessed by the dollar-syntax (`$`) followed by their index in square brackets (`[]`),
starting with 0, like `${NAMES}[0]` for `Matti` and `${NAMES}[1]` for `Teppo`.

Example:
```robotframework
*** Test Cases ***
List Example
    Log    First Name: ${NAMES}[0]    # Logs 'First Name: Matti'
    Log    Second Name: ${NAMES}[1]   # Logs 'Second Name: Teppo'
```

#### Dictionary Variable Definition

Dictionary variables store key-value pairs and use the ampersand-syntax `&{variable_name}`.
Key-value pairs are assigned using the `key=value` format.

Example:
```robotframework
*** Variables ***
&{USER1}        name=Matti     address=xxx         phone=123
&{USER2}        name=Teppo     address=yyy         phone=456
&{COMBINED}     first=1        second=${2}         third=third
```
You can escape equal signs in keys with a backslash (`\=`) to prevent misinterpretation.

Values of dictionary-like variables can be accessed by the dollar-syntax (`$`) followed by the key in square brackets (`[]`),
like `${USER1}[name]` for `Matti` and `${USER1}[address]` for `xxx`.
No quotes are needed around the key name.

Variables can also be used to set the accessed key dynamically.
Assuming `${key}` contains the value `phone`, `${USER1}[${key}]` would resolve to `123`.

Dictionary variables in Robot Framework are **ordered**,
which means they persist their assignment order and can be iterated,
and **support attribute access**, allowing you to reference dictionary keys using syntax like `${USER1.name}`.


### Return values from keywords

In Robot Framework, values returned by keywords can be assigned to variables,
enabling data to be passed between different keywords.

These variables are local to the block where they are created,
i.e., in the test|task or keyword where the assignment is made.
If a variable has already been defined in the `*** Variables ***` section,
it will just be locally overwritten by the new value.
Once the block is left, the original value of the variable is restored.
See [Variable Scopes](Chapter_5_Exploring_Advanced_Constructs.md#variable-scope) for more information.

An assignment is always constructed by the variable or variables that shall be assigned to,
followed by an optional equal sign (`=`) and the keyword call that
shall be executed and will return the value(s) to be assigned.

#### Assigning to Scalar Variables

In the simplest case, a keyword returns exactly one value,
which can be assigned to a scalar variable using the dollar-syntax `${variable_name}`.

```robotframework
*** Settings ***
Library    OperatingSystem




*** Test Cases ***
Returning Example
    ${server_log} =    Get File    server.log
    Should Contain    ${server_log}    Successfully started
```

In this example, the content of the file `server.log`, which is returned by the `Get File` keyword, is stored in the `${server_log}` variable and later verified by the `Should Contain` keyword.
Although the `=` sign is optional, its usage makes the assignment visually more explicit.

If keywords return multiple values, still the scalar variable syntax with `${var}` is used.
All values are assigned to the variable as a list of values and can be accessed as described in the [List Variables](#list-variables) section.

```robotframework
*** Settings ***
Library    OperatingSystem


*** Test Cases ***
Returning a List Example
    ${files}    List Files In Directory    server/logs
    Log    First File: ${files}[0]
    Log    Last File: ${files}[-1]
```

In cases where a keyword returns a defined number of values, they can be assigned to multiple scalar variables in one assignment.
In the following example, the keyword `Split Path` returns two values, the path and the file name.

```robotframework
*** Settings ***
Library    OperatingSystem


*** Test Cases ***
Multiple Return Example
    ${path}    ${file} =    Split Path    server/logs/server.log
    Should Be Equal    ${path}    server/logs
    Should Be Equal    ${file}    server.log
```


### `VAR` Statement

The `VAR` statement in Robot Framework is a way to create
and assign values to variables directly within a test|task case or keyword during execution.
While the `*** Variables ***` section allows defining variables for a whole suite,
the `VAR` statement is used within the body of a test|task case or keyword,
allowing more control over when and where the variable is created.

Example use cases for the `VAR` statement:
- **Combining values during test|task execution**: Variables that shall have content based on information gathered during test|task execution.
- **Conditional assignments**: In some scenarios, it may be necessary to assign different values to a variable based on conditions that occur during test|task execution.
- **Initialization of variables**: In a FOR-loop (see [FOR-Loops](Chapter_5_Exploring_Advanced_Constructs.md#for-loops)), it may be necessary to collect information and add it to a list. This list can be initialized with the `VAR` statement as an empty list before the loop starts and then filled with values during the loop.

By default, variables created with the `VAR` statement are **local** to the test|task case, task, or keyword where they are defined.
This means that they cannot be accessed outside that specific test|task or keyword, ensuring that variables do not interfere with other parts of the test|task suite.

However, the `VAR` statement can also be used to create variables with a broader scope, such as suite-wide or global variables, when needed.
These variables can then be accessed outside of the test|task or keyword where they were originally created.

For more details on this topic, refer to the section on [Variable Scope](Chapter_5_Exploring_Advanced_Constructs.md#variable-scope).


### Variable Scope

In Robot Framework, variables have different scopes, which define where they can be accessed and used. Understanding the scope of variables is crucial for managing data within tests and keywords.

1. **Local Scope**: Variables created within a test|task or keyword, by assignment or `VAR` statement, are by default local to that specific test|task or keyword. They cannot be accessed outside of that block and are destroyed once the block is completed. This means that a local variable created in one test|task cannot be accessed inside the body of a called keyword or a subsequent test|task.

2. **Test|Task Scope**: Variables with test|task scope are available throughout the execution of a specific test|task. They can be created within the test|task by, for example, `VAR` statement inside the test|task body or any called keyword. They are accessible in all called keywords during the execution of this particular test|task.

3. **Suite Scope**: Variables defined at the suite level, for example in the `*** Variables ***` section or through resource files, are available to all tests|tasks and keywords called within the suite.

4. **Global Scope**: Variables with global scope are available throughout the entire test execution, across all suites. These variables can be set by command-line arguments or `VAR` statement and should be used cautiously to avoid conflicts and ensure test|task independence.

Examples and more details on variable scope can be found in the [Variable Scope](Chapter_5_Exploring_Advanced_Constructs.md#variable-scope) section.




## User Keyword Definition & Arguments

User Keywords in Robot Framework allow users to create their own
keywords by combining existing keywords into reusable higher-level actions.
They help improve readability, maintainability, and modularity in
automation by abstracting complex sequences into named actions.
User Keywords are defined syntactically very similarly to tests|tasks
and are defined in the `*** Keywords ***` section of a suite file or resource file.

### `*** Keywords ***` Section

The `*** Keywords ***` section is indentation-based similar to the `*** Test Cases ***` section.
The user keywords defined are unindented, while their body implementation is indented by multiple spaces.

See these sections for more details about
[Basic Test/Task Syntax](Chapter_2_Getting_Started.md#basic-testtask-syntax)
and [Calling imported Keywords](Chapter_2_Getting_Started.md#calling-imported-keywords).

This section can be part of suites or resource files.
While keywords defined in suites can solely be used in the suite they are defined in,
keywords defined in resource files can be used in any suite that imports these resource files.
See [Resource Files](Chapter_2_Getting_Started.md#resource-files) for more details.
<!--
TODO: find a better example.
I do not want to have third-party libraries in the syllabus like SeleniumLibrary or Browser.

Example of defining a user keyword:
```robotframework
*** Keywords ***
Login To System

    Input Text    username_field    ${USERNAME}
    Input Text    password_field    ${PASSWORD}
    Click Button  login_buttom
```
-->

As a reference for how defined keywords are documented, see [Keyword Interface and Documentation](Chapter_2_Getting_Started.md#keyword-interface-and-documentation).


### User Keyword Names

The names of User Keywords should be descriptive and clear, reflecting the purpose of the keyword.
Well-named keywords make tests more readable and easier to understand.
Like test case names, keyword names are case-insensitive and can include spaces.

They are defined without indentation, and the subsequent lines until the next unindented line are considered the body of the keyword.
The following topics explain how to structure the body of a keyword.

### User Keyword Settings

User keywords can have similar settings as test cases,
and they have the same square bracket syntax separating them from keyword calls.
All available settings are listed below and explained in this section or in sections linked below.

- `[Documentation]` Used for setting user keyword documentation. (see [Keyword Documentation](#keyword-documentation))
- `[Arguments]` Specifies user keyword arguments to hand over values to the keyword. (see [Keyword Arguments](#keyword-arguments))
- `[Setup]`, `[Teardown]` Specify user keyword setup and teardown. (see [Teardowns (Suite, Test|Task, Keyword)](Chapter_4_Advanced_Structuring_and_Execution.md#teardowns-suite-testtask-keyword))
- `[Tags]` (*) Sets tags for the keyword, which can be used for filtering in documentation and attribution for post-processing results.
- `[Timeout]` (*) Sets the possible user keyword timeout.
- `[Return]` (*) Deprecated.

(*) These settings are not part of this syllabus.

### User Keyword Documentation

Each keyword can have a `[Documentation]` setting to provide a description of the keyword's purpose and usage.

The first logical line, until the first empty row, is considered the *short documentation* and is also displayed in the `log.html` test protocol.

Proper documentation helps maintain clarity, especially in larger projects.
It is a good practice to document what the keyword does,
any important notes regarding its usage,
and additional information about the arguments it accepts if not self-explanatory.

<!--
TODO

Should we describe simple syntax?
Where? Here? or in a separate chapter in Advanced Constructs?

-->

### User Keyword Arguments

User Keywords can accept arguments, which make them more dynamic and reusable in various contexts.
The `[Arguments]` setting is used to define the arguments a user keyword expects.

See also Chapter 2 [Keyword Arguments](Chapter_2_Getting_Started.md#keyword-arguments) for an introduction to argument kinds.

Arguments are defined by `[Arguments]` followed by the argument names separated by multiple spaces in the syntax of scalar variables.

Unlike Library Keywords, User Keywords cannot define argument types like `string`, `number`, etc., as described in the [Argument Types](Chapter_2_Getting_Started.md#argument-types) section.

#### Defining Mandatory Arguments

Example that defines a keyword with two arguments:
```robotframework
*** Keywords ***
Verify File Contains
    [Documentation]    Verifies that a file contains a specific text.
    ...
    ...    The keyword opens the file specified by the file path and checks if it contains the expected content.
    [Arguments]    ${file_path}    ${expected_content}
    ${server_log} =    Get File    ${file_path}
    Should Contain    ${server_log}    ${expected_content}
```

All variables, the arguments, and the return value, are local to the keyword body and do not exist outside of the keyword.

This keyword may be called in a test case like this:
```robotframework
*** Test Cases ***
Check Server Log
    Verify File Contains    server.log    Successfully started
```

In that case, the argument `${file_path}` is assigned the value `server.log`, and `${expected_content}` is assigned the value `Successfully started`.

#### Defining Optional Arguments

Optional arguments can be defined by assigning a default value to the argument in the `[Arguments]` setting.
All optional arguments must be defined after all mandatory arguments.

Default values are assigned by the equal sign (`=`)
followed by the default value without any spaces like `${ignore_case}=True`.

The assigned default values may also contain or be earlier defined variables, i.e., in the `*** Variables ***` section.

Example:
```robotframework
*** Keywords ***
Verify File Contains
    [Documentation]    Verifies that a file contains a specific text.
    ...
    ...    The keyword opens the file specified by the ``file_path``
    ...    and checks if it contains the ``expected_content``.
    ...
    ...    By default, the verification is case-insensitive
    ...    but can be changed with the optional argument ``ignore_case``.
    [Arguments]    ${file_path}    ${expected_content}    ${ignore_case}=True
    ${server_log} =    Get File    ${file_path}
    Should Contain    ${server_log}    ${expected_content}    ignore_case=${ignore_case}
```

#### Other Argument Kinds

Other argument kinds like **Named-Only Arguments**, **Free Named Arguments**, or
**Variable Number of Positional Arguments** should be known,
but their definition and usage are not part of this syllabus.

### RETURN Statement

The `RETURN` statement (case-sensitive) in Robot Framework is used to return values from a User Keyword
to be used in further test steps or stored in variables.
This allows test execution to pass data between different keywords.

It can return one or more values.
If more than one value is returned, they can either be assigned
to multiple variables or stored as a list in a single variable.

Example:
```robotframework
*** Keywords ***
Get File Name From Path
    [Arguments]    ${file_path}
    ${path}    ${file} =    Split Path    ${file_path}
    RETURN    ${file}
```

The `RETURN` statement is normally used at the end of a keyword definition,
because it will end the keyword execution at that point and return to the caller.
This behavior can be used to conditionally end a keyword execution early together with an `IF` or `TRY-EXCEPT` statement.

The `RETURN` statement cannot return a value from a keyword call directly like in other programming languages.
The return value must be stored in a variable first and then be returned by the `RETURN` statement.

This is the end for today ;-)

## Resource Files

### File Type & Structure
**Resource files** allow you to centralize keywords, variables, and settings across multiple suites. These files have the extension `.resource` and are commonly used to define reusable components.

- **Resource Files**: Include sections like `*** Keywords ***`, `*** Variables ***`, and `*** Settings ***`, similar to suite files but are not parsed for tests or tasks.

### Designing Reusable Keywords
When designing reusable keywords in resource files, ensure they are generic and parameterized to fit multiple contexts. This promotes reuse and reduces redundancy in automation.

### Best Practices
Avoid circular imports when organizing resource files and libraries. Ensure resource files are modular, focusing on specific domains or functionalities to make them easier to maintain.

## Documentation

Robot Framework provides tools to generate keyword documentation using the `libdoc` tool. This automatically generates structured documentation for libraries and resource files, making it easier to reference keyword functionality during development.
