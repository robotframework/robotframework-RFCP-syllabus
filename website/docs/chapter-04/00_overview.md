# Overview

As a Robot Framework automation project expands, the increasing number of tests|tasks adds complexity to the project.
This chapter explores advanced structuring and execution techniques to effectively manage this complexity and control the execution flow.

We will cover methods for error handling and cleaning up after failed tests|tasks using **Teardowns**, as well as preparing individual or multiple suites and tests|tasks for execution with **Setups**.
Additionally, filtering subsets of tests|tasks based on tags will be discussed, which is essential for managing test|task execution efficiently.
