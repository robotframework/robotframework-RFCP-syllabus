:::K1[LO-1.5.2]

List and recall the key objectives and organizational form of the Robot Framework Foundation

:::

::::

The **Robot Framework Foundation** (officially known as **Robot Framework ry**) is a non-profit association based in Helsinki, Finland, dedicated to promoting the use, development, and maintenance of the open-source Robot Framework. The foundation ensures that Robot Framework remains freely available and viable for both test automation and robotic process automation (RPA) in the future.

Key objectives of the foundation include:

- **Support for Core Development**: The foundation funds and enables the core development, maintenance, and evolution of the Robot Framework, ensuring it is freely available to everyone. It also supports ecosystem and user-contributed projects that further enhance the framework's capabilities.

- **Democratic Governance**: The foundation operates under democratic principles, with a **Board of Directors** elected annually by its members. The board oversees the foundation's operations, and membership primarily consists of companies that contribute financially to support the frameworkâ€™s ongoing development through membership fees.

- **Platform Maintenance**: The foundation is responsible for maintaining key infrastructure, such as the official website, GitHub repositories, and community platforms. These resources are crucial to sustaining a healthy ecosystem and fostering collaboration among users and contributors.

- **Community Support and Events**: The foundation plays a central role in organizing **RoboCon**, the annual Robot Framework User Conference, which brings together users, developers, and contributors to share knowledge and insights. Additionally, it helps to disseminate knowledge about test automation and RPA through community events and documentation efforts.

- **Funding of Ecosystem Projects**: Whenever possible, the foundation finances open-source projects that are proposed by community members, aiming to support broader ecosystem development and innovation.

As a non-profit, all funds are directed towards the development and promotion of the Robot Framework, ensuring that it remains accessible to all users without commercial restrictions.

More information, including a list of foundation members, is available at **[robotframework.org/foundation](https://robotframework.org/foundation)**.

This structure and mission ensure that Robot Framework continues to grow and serve the needs of its community while maintaining an open and democratic approach to its development and governance.
