# 1 Introduction to Robot Framework

The upcoming chapters provide a concise overview of Robot Framework, including its core structure, use cases in test automation and [Robotic Process Automation](../glossary#robotic-process-automation) (RPA), and key specification styles like keyword-driven and behavior-driven testing. You'll learn about its architecture, syntax, and how test cases and tasks are organized. Additionally, the chapters explain the open-source licensing under Apache 2.0, the role of the [Robot Framework Foundation](../glossary#robot-framework-foundation) in maintaining the ecosystem, and the foundational web resources available for further exploration and contributions.
