- [ ] Use of complex nested structures is not possible.
    > Robot Framework avoids complex nested structures but they can be used.

    > Specialized symbols and character sequences are kept to a minimum.
- [X] Use of natural language-like keywords.
- [ ] There are no programming control flows such as if statements and for loops.
    > Control flows are present in Robot Framework but a lot can be done without them.
- [X] Reliance on a tabular format.

### Which of the following statements is TRUE for `*** Test Cases ***` or `*** Tasks ***` section?

1. [ ] The section can be used in resource files.
    > Not allowed in resource files
1. [ ] The section can only have keyword calls in them.
    > Syllabus chapter mentions multiple settings (also control flows, var assigns, groups)
1. [ ] The section is not mandatory in a suite file.
    > One kind of this section is mandatory in suite files
1. [X] The section defines the executable elements of a suite.


### Which TWO of the following sections use indentation to define the body of an element?

> LO-2.2.1 Understand and apply the mechanics of indentation and separation in Robot Framework.

- [ ] `*** Settings ***`
    > Items have no bodies requiring indentation
- [ ] `*** Variables ***`
    > Items have no bodies requiring indentation
- [X] `*** Test Cases ***`
    > Keywork calls in the body of a test case are indented.
- [x] `*** Keywords ***`
    > Keywork calls in the body of a keyword are indented.
- [ ] `*** Comments ***`
    > Contents are completely ignored


### Which THREE of the following are execution artifacts generated by Robot Framework

> LO-2.3.2 Explain the execution artifacts generated by Robot Framework.

- [ ] Configuration files
    > Configuration files are not generated as a result of test execution, but are rather part of the project setup and development.
- [x] Log files
- [ ] Resource files
    > Resource files are used by Robot Framework but are not created as execution artifacts; they are components used by tests.
- [x] Report files
- [x] Output files


### Match the correct prefixes to different variable access types

> LO-3.2.1-1 Recall the four syntactical access types to variables with their prefixes

Given the following prefixes:
```
1. @
2. $
3. %
4. &
```
Put the list below in the correct order to match the given prefixes

1. Store multiple values in a list structure
2. Store values as a single entity
3. Read access to an environment variable.
4. Store key-value pairs in a dictionary structure.


### Which TWO of the following statements are key characteristics of Test|Task|Teardown

> LO-4.2.2-1 Recall key characteristics, benefits, and syntax of Test|Task Teardown

- [x] When Test|Task Teardown fails, the test|task is marked as failed in reports and logs.
- [ ] Test|Task Teardown runs only when the Test|Task passes.
    > Runs always.
- [x] All keywords within the Test|Task Teardown are executed, even when one of them fails.
- [ ] Test|Task Teardown must be set separately for each test|task.
    > Can be set glob



### Which of the following statements describes the purpose of tags most accurately

> LO-4.4 Recall the purpose of Test|Task Tags in Robot Framework

1. [ ] Tags are case-sensitive labels used for grouping suites and tests|tasks.
    > Tags are case-insensitive and only used for tests|tasks.
1. [ ] Tags are assigned to suites to create statistical summary of the suite results.
    > Assigned to tests|tasks.
1. [x] "Tags offer a simple mechanism for classifying and controlling the execution of tests|tasks."
1. [ ] "Only pre-defined tags, such as `smoke`, `regression`, and `critical` can be assigned to tests|tasks"
    > Tags are free-form text labels.


### In the given scenario which of the test cases logs only a single entry

__Read__ the keyword explaination carefully to understand the given scenario!

#### Log Many

**Arguments**

`* messages`

**Documentation**

```
Logs the given messages as separate entries using the INFO level.

Supports also logging list and dictionary variable items individually.
```

#### Variables

The following Variables are available to each test case.

```robot
*** Variables ***
@{user_names}    Alice    Bob    Charlie
&{name_id_pairs}    Alice=001    Bob=002    Charlie=003
```

> LO-5.1.4.2 Recall that `@{list}` unpacks the values of a list variable when accessed

- [ ] ```robot
  *** Test Cases ***
  Test A
    Log Many    Alice    Bob    Charlie
  ```
  > 'Logs three entries: "Alice", "Bob", and "Charlie".'
- [x] ```robot
  *** Test Cases ***
  Test B
    Log Many    ${user_names}
  ```
    > This logs a single entry: the string representation of the list.
    >
    > It logs: `['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']`
- [ ] ```robot
  *** Test Cases ***
  Test C
    Log Many    @{user_names}
  ```
    > Logs three entries: `Alice`, `Bob`, and `Charlie`.
- [ ] ```robot
  *** Test Cases ***
  Test D
    Log Many    @{name_id_pairs}
  ```
    > Logs three entries: `Alice`, `Bob`, and `Charlie`
    > this is a rare use case but if dictionaries are unpacked as list, it is a list of its keys.

### Which of the following statements describes the contents of built-in variable `${EXECDIR}`

> LO-5.1.6 Recall that Robot Framework provides access to execution information via Built-In variables

1. [ ] "It is an absolute path to the directory where the current suite or resource file is located."
    > Description for `${CURDIR}`
1. [x] It is an absolute path to the directory where test execution was started from.
1. [ ] It is an absolute path to the directory where output files are written.
    > Description for `${OUTPUT_DIR}`.
1. [ ] It is an absolute path to the system temporary directory.
    > Description for `${OUTPUT_DIR}`.
