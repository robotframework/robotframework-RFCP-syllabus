| **Task Suite**                                  | Suite files that have at least one task and do not contain any test cases.                                                          |
| **Test Automation**                             | The use of software tools to execute tests automatically, reducing manual effort.                                                   |
| **Test Cases Section**                          | This section defines the executable elements of a suite, specifically test cases.                                                   |
| **Test Suite**                                  | Suite files that have at least one test case and do not contain any tasks.                                                          |
