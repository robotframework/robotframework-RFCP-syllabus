It often includes both functional and non-functional aspects (e.g., accessibility, security) and may use simulated components. System Integration Testing: Focuses on the interaction between the system under test and external services, as well as on the integration of multiple systems into a larger system, ensuring that all integrated components communicate and function together as expected. Acceptance Testing: Aims to validate that the system meets business requirements and is ready for deployment or release. This often includes different forms of acceptance testing (e.g., user acceptance, operational acceptance, regulatory acceptance) and is frequently written or conducted by end-users or stakeholders to confirm the system’s readiness for use. Acceptance tests, often defined by business stakeholders in approaches like Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD), can be automated and executed earlier in the development process. This ensures that the solution aligns with business requirements from the start and provides immediate feedback, reducing costly changes later. End-to-End Testing: Verifies that a complete workflow or process within the system operates as intended, covering all interconnected subsystems, interfaces, and external components. End-to-end tests ensure the correct functioning of the application in real-world scenarios by simulating user interactions from start to finish.  Robot Framework's flexibility and support for external libraries make it an excellent tool for automating these comprehensive test cases, ensuring seamless interaction between components and validating the system's behavior also in production or production-like conditions.  Robot Framework is typically not used for component testing nor integration testing because its primary strength lies in higher-level testing, such as system, acceptance, and end-to-end testing, where behavior-driven and keyword-based approaches excel. Component testing requires low-level, granular tests focusing on individual units of code, often necessitating direct interaction with the codebase, mocking, or stubbing, which are better handled by unit testing frameworks like JUnit, pytest, or NUnit. Similarly, integration testing at a low level often requires precise control over service interactions, such as API stubs or protocol-level testing, which may not align with Robot Framework's abstraction-oriented design. While Robot Framework can technically handle these cases through custom libraries, its overhead and design philosophy make it less efficient compared to tools specifically tailored for low-level and tightly scoped testing tasks.

Robot Framework, with its keyword-driven approach, vast ecosystem of libraries, simplicity, and scalability, is widely adopted for RPA tasks. Robot Framework allows users to automate most workflows using ready-made keyword libraries that provide a wide range of functionalities. These libraries can be combined and reused in user-defined keywords, making automation simple and efficient. For custom functionalities or more complex tasks, Robot Framework also offers the flexibility to create custom keyword libraries using Python, enabling advanced use cases and seamless integration with unique systems.

In Robot Framework, the test data is written using the defined syntax and contains keyword calls and argument values that make the test case or task definitions structured in suites. Execution Layer: In Robot Framework, the execution layer consists of the framework itself, including its core components and APIs. It parses and interprets the test data syntax to build an execution model. The execution layer is responsible for processing this execution model to execute the library keywords with their argument values, logging results, and generating reports. Adaptation Layer: This layer provides the connection between Robot Framework and the system under test (SUT). In Robot Framework, this is where the keyword libraries, which contain code responsible for interacting with different technologies and interfaces, such as those for UI, API, database interactions, or others, are located. These keyword libraries enable interaction with different technologies and interfaces, ensuring the automation is flexible and adaptable to various environments.  Editors/IDEs that offer support for Robot Framework's syntax are tools that support or integrate in these layers. When writing tests|tasks or keywords, the editor supports the definition layer. When executing or debugging tests|tasks, the editor supports the execution layer. When writing keywords in e.g. Python for keyword libraries, the editor supports the adaptation layer. Therefore also other additional extensions of Robot Framework can be categorized into these layers.

Keywords define the specific actions that must be executed in a particular order, similar to procedural programming. The emphasis is on the actions performed by the automation/tester.  For example, in Robot Framework, a Keyword-Driven test might look like:  *** Test Cases *** Verify Foundation Link Open Page http://robotframework.org Click Button FOUNDATION Verify Title Foundation | Robot Framework Verify Url https://robotframework.org/foundation   Verifications or assertions can be imperative, though they are often phrased as assertions, such as Title Should Be Foundation | Robot Framework, adding flexibility to how outcomes are checked.  The advantage of this style lies in its clarity and structure. It provides a straightforward representation of the task flow, making it easy to understand what actions will be executed.  Separation of the executed step/keyword and its arguments/data with spaces improves the readability of tests or tasks. Flow and data can be parsed separately by the consumer.

This style often incorporates embedded arguments into the steps and uses natural language constructs like Given, When, Then, And &amp; But.  In Robot Framework, behavior-driven tests may look like:  *** Test Cases *** Opening Foundation Page Given &quot;robotframework.org&quot; is open When the user clicks the &quot;FOUNDATION&quot; button Then the page title should be &quot;Foundation | Robot Framework&quot; And the url should be &quot;https://robotframework.org/foundation&quot;   The prefixes Given, When, Then, And and But are basically ignored by Robot Framework if a keyword is found matching the rest of the name. A key difference between Robot Framework's behavior-driven style and BDD frameworks like Cucumber or most others is the ability in Robot Framework to use multiple keyword layers. In other BDD frameworks the code that implements a sentence like Given &quot;robotframework.org&quot; is open. is referred to as a step definition. Step definitions are written in a programming language (typically Java, JavaScript, Ruby, or Python) and map natural language steps from a Gherkin feature file to code. Therefore there are no multiple layers of keywords that can be logged into execution protocols. Robot Framework allows you to create user keywords that can further call other user or library keywords, providing greater flexibility, modularity and much more detailed logging.

It is an imperative style, comparable to procedural programming. It is structured, clear, and well-suited for scenarios where the steps are more technical or detailed and involve a larger number of keyword calls within a test or task. Additionally, this style is better suited for complex tasks or handling complex data, as it enables a clear separation between keyword names and their argument values. Behavior-Driven Style emphasizes how the system behaves from the user's point of view, using more natural language and focusing on expected outcomes. It is a declarative style that can be compared to writing user stories or acceptance criteria. It is optimized for business-oriented descriptions of functionality and is often more suitable for communicating with non-technical stakeholders. This style can get less understandable when the amount of steps increases or the amount of defined data in the steps increases.  Both styles can be applied within Robot Framework, offering flexibility depending on the context of the automation task.

While in Robotic Process Automation (RPA), the data used in an automation workflow is typically acquired dynamically from an external source, in testing, the data is specifically chosen to cover different scenarios or cases. Therefore, this method of defining data combinations statically in the suite files is normally not applicable to RPA.  The purpose of Data-Driven Testing is to automate the same sequence of actions or scenario with different sets of input and/or expected output data.  In this style, a single user keyword, which contains the whole test logic or sequence of actions, is executed with multiple data variations, making it highly effective for repetitive tests, where the logic stays the same but the data changes, without duplicating the test logic for each case.  Robot Framework offers a convenient feature for this approach through Test Templates.  Benefits of Data-Driven Specification:  Efficiency: Reduces the need to write redundant test cases by reusing the same workflow with different data inputs.Clarity: Keeps the test logic separate from the data, making it easier to manage large data sets.Scalability: Suitable for scenarios where the same functionality needs to be tested under various conditions, such as verifying form inputs or performing calculations with different values.

Tests or Tasks have a body made up of keyword calls and Robot Framework statements like IF or VAR, which represent the actions or steps executed during the test or task execution.

Keywords in Robot Framework follow the concepts used in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Keyword-Driven Testing.  Definition: one or more words used as a reference to a specific set of actions intended to be performed during the execution of one or more tests or tasks.  There are two types of keywords in Robot Framework:  User Keywords: Written in Robot Framework syntax, they are mainly used as wrappers around sets of other keywords or to implement actions not readily available in existing library keywords. User Keywords improve readability, understandability, maintainability, and structure. These keywords always call other keywords or commands within their body, which is why they are also called higher-level keywords. In other literature, such keywords are also referred to as Business Keywords or Composite Keywords. Example:  *** Keywords *** Login User [Arguments] ${login} ${password} Set Login Name ${login} Set Password ${password} Execute Login   Library Keywords: Typically written in Python, but they may also be implemented using other technologies. These keywords typically interact with the system under test (SUT) or the system to be controlled by RPA, or execute specific actions such as calculations or conversions. From the viewpoint of Robot Framework, such keywords are not composed of other keywords and do form the lowest level of keywords. Therefore, they are also referred to as low-level keywords. In other literature, such keywords are also called Technical Keywords or Atomic Keywords.  A User Keyword consists of a name, optional arguments, and a body of keyword calls that may invoke other user keywords, library keywords, or other statements such as variable definitions or flow control.  During execution, each keyword call is logged, providing fine-grained detail in the execution logs. This includes all levels of keywords—from those called directly by a test or task to those nested within user keywords, all the way down to the execution of library keywords. This granular logging and detailed execution documentation is one of the key advantages of Robot Framework compared to other automation tools.

From a user perspective there are three different kinds of libraries:  Robot Framework Standard Libraries: These are libraries that are shipped with Robot Framework and are available without any additional installation. See documentation of ext: Robot Framework Standard Libraries for more information.3rd Party Libraries / External Libraries: These are libraries have been developed and maintained by community members and have to be installed/downloaded separately.Custom Libraries: These libraries are developed by the users themselves to solve specific problems or to encapsulate more complex functionality.  Further more detailed information about the different types of libraries and are described in later chapters.  To import a library into a suite or resource file the Library setting is used in the *** Settings *** section followed by the name of the library as long as they are located in the Python module search path, which automatically happens if they are installed via pip. The name of the library is case-sensitive and should be taken from the library's keyword documentation. By default, libraries in Robot Framework are implemented in Python and the name of the library is the name of the Python module that contains the library implementation.  Alternatively, if a library is not in Python module search path, a library can be imported using the path to the Python module. See 2.4.3 Import Paths.  Be aware that the library BuiltIn is always imported invisibly and does not need to be imported explicitly.  Example:  *** Settings *** Library OperatingSystem Library Browser Library DatabaseLibrary   Once a library is imported, all keywords from that library are available for use in that suite or resource file. Which keywords are available can be seen in the keyword documentation of the library or may be visible in the IDE by code completion, depending on the IDE extension being used.

LO-2.4.2-2 Use resource files to import new keywords.  As mentioned before resource files are used to organize and store keywords and variables that are used in multiple suites.  They share a similar structure and the same syntax as suite files, but they do not contain test cases or tasks. See 2.2 Basic Suite File Syntax for more information about the structure of suite files and 3.1 Resource File Structure for more details of their structure.  They can contain other keyword imports, which cause the keywords from the imported libraries or resource files to be available in the suites where the resource file is imported. The same applies for variables that are defined and imported from other resource files. Therefore keywords from a library that have been imported in a resource file are also available in the suite that imports that resource file.  To import a resource file into a suite or resource file the Resource setting is used in the *** Settings *** section followed by the path to the resource file. See 2.4.3 Import Paths for more information about the path to the resource file.  Resource files shall have the extension .resource to make it clear what they are..resource and .robot extensions are also recognized by IDE extensions, supporting Robot Framework.

When importing libraries or resource files via a path, the path can be either an absolute path or a relative path. If a relative path is given, the path is resolved relative to the data file that is importing the library or resource file.  If an absolute path is given, the resource file or library is searched for at the given path.  If a relative path is given, the resource file or library is searched for relative to the data file that is importing it and then relative to the Python module search path. This module search path is defined by the Python interpreter that executes Robot Framework and can be influenced by the environment variable PYTHONPATH or by using the CLI-Argument --pythonpath when executing robot.  For path separators, it is strongly recommended to always use forward slashes (/), and even on Windows, not to use backslashes (\\). This is because backslashes are used as escape characters in Robot Framework, which can cause issues when used in paths. Forward slashes are supported on all operating systems when used in Robot Framework.  When choosing the location of resource files or libraries, it should be taken into that consideration that absolute paths are typically not portable and therefore should be avoided. Relative paths are portable as long as they are related to the data file that is importing using them, as long as that relative path is part of the project structure.  However the most stable and recommended way is to use the Python Path/module search path to import them. That path needs to be defined when executing Robot Framework but can lead to more uniform and stable imports, because each suite or resource file can use the same path to import the same resource file or library, independent of the location of the importing suite or resource file.

It allows you to import keywords from external libraries (Library) or resource files (Resource), and import variables (Variables) from variable files (not part of this syllabus) that are needed for execution in the containing tests|tasks.  In this section, the suite name, that is normally derived from the file name, can be redefined with the Name setting and its documentation can be defined with the Documentation setting.  Additional metadata can be defined by multiple Metadata entries, which can contain key-value pairs that can be used to store additional information about the suite, like the author, the version, or related requirements of the suite.  This section can also define keywords called for execution flow control, such as Suite Setup and Suite Teardown, which are executed before and after the suite's tests run. See 4.1 Setups (Suite, Test|Task, Keyword) and4.2 Teardowns (Suite, Test|Task, Keyword) for more information.  Additionally, some settings can define defaults for all tests|tasks in the suite, which can be extended or overwritten in the individual tests|tasks. Those settings are prefixed with either Test or Task, according to the type of suite and the following section type (*** Test Cases *** or *** Tasks ***), like Test Timeout, while the local setting is in square brackets and without the prefix like: [Timeout].  Test Setup/Task Setup (locally: [Setup]) and Test Teardown/Task Teardown (locally [Teardown]) define which keywords are executed before and after each individual test|task. The local setting overrides the suite's default. See 4.1 Setups (Suite, Test|Task, Keyword) and4.2 Teardowns (Suite, Test|Task, Keyword) for more information. Test Timeout/Task Timeout (locally [Timeout]) defines the maximum time a test|task is allowed to run before it is marked as failed. The local setting overrides the suite's default. Test Tags/Task Tags (locally [Tags]) define tags that are assigned to tests|tasks in the suite and can be used to filter tests|tasks for execution or for attributing information to the tests|tasks. The local setting appends or removes tags defined by the suite's default. See 4.4 Test|Task Tags and Filtering Execution for more information. Test Template/Task Template (locally [Template]) defines a template keyword that defines the test|task body and is typically used for Data-Driven Testing where each test has the same keywords but different argument data.

As mentioned before, Robot Framework uses an indentation-based and space-separated syntax to structure keywords, test cases, and tasks.  Two or more spaces are used to separate or indent statements in Robot Framework files, while a single space is a valid character in tokens (e.g. keyword names, argument values, variables, etc.). The clear recommendation for separators is to use four spaces or more to unambiguously make it visible to a potential reader where elements are separated or indented.  A statement in Robot Framework is a logical line that contains specific data tokens, which are separated by multiple spaces (separator tokens) and typically end with a line break (end-of-line token). To create a statement spanning multiple lines, literal lines can be continued by adding ... (three dots) and a separator token at the beginning of the next line, maintaining the same indentation level as the line being continued.  Example 1: A keyword call is a statement that consists of a keyword name and its arguments, which are separated by two or more spaces from the keyword name and from each other. An optional assignment of the return value can be possible as well. The line comments starting with a hash # show the tokens in the statement.  Plain example for better readability:  *** Test Cases *** Test Case Name Keyword Call argument one argument two Keyword Call ... argument one ... argument two ${variable_assignment} Keyword Getter Call   Example with tokens in comments:  *** Test Cases *** # TESTCASE HEADER | Test Case Name # TESTCASE | EOL Keyword Call argument one argument two # SEP | KEYWORD | SEP | ARGUMENT | SEP | ARGUMENT | EOL Keyword Call # SEP | KEYWORD | EOL ... argument one # SEP | CONTINUATION | ARGUMENT | EOL ... argument two # SEP | CONTINUATION | ARGUMENT | EOL ${variable_assignment} Keyword Getter Call # SEP | ASSIGNMENT | SEP | KEYWORD | EOL   In the example above, the test case Test Case Name contains three keyword calls. The first keyword call Keyword Call has two arguments, argument one and argument two. The second keyword call even though it is split over two lines is considered one logical line and identical to the first keyword call. The third keyword call is a keyword call that assigns the return value of the keyword Keyword Getter Call to the variable ${variable_assignment}.  Example 2: In the *** Settings *** section, the settings are separated from their values by four or more spaces.  *** Settings *** # SETTINGS HDR | Documentation This is the first line of documentation. # SETTING | SEP | VALUE | EOL ... # just CONTINUATION and End Of Line ... This is the second line of documentation. # CONTINUATION | VALUE | EOL Resource keywords.resource # SET | SEP | VALUE | EOL   All elements themselves in their section are written without any indentation. So, settings in the *** Settings *** section, test cases in the *** Test Cases *** section, and keywords in the *** Keywords *** section are written without any indentation. However, when defining tests|tasks and keywords, indentation is used to define their body, while their name is still un-indented, e.g., after a test case name, all subsequent lines that are part of the test case body are indented by two or more spaces.  That means that a body statement always starts with a separator token, followed by a data token, like e.g. variable or keyword as seen in the examples above.  The body ends when either a new un-indented element (e.g. test case or keyword) is defined or another section like *** Keywords *** starts or the end of the file is reached.  Within the body of tests|tasks and keywords, control structures like loops or conditions can be used. Their content should be indented by additional four spaces to make it clear that they are part of the control structure. However, this is not mandatory and only a recommendation to make the file more readable.  While single tabulators (\\t) as well as two or more spaces are valid separators, it is recommended to use multiple spaces for indentation and separation and avoid tabulators. This can prevent issues where different editors align text to a grid (e.g., 4 spaces) when using tabs, making it difficult for users to distinguish between tabs and spaces. It could cause a single tabulator to look the same as a single space in the editor, which would lead to misinterpretation of the file structure by a human reader.

Empty lines are allowed and encouraged to structure data files and make them more readable. In the next example, the sections are visibly separated by two empty lines, and the tests are separated by one empty line. Empty lines are technically not relevant and are ignored while parsing the file.  By default, each statement is terminated by a line break, allowing only one statement per literal line. However, for better readability, or to add line breaks in documentation, statements can span multiple lines by using ... (three dots) and a separator at the start of the next line with the same indentation level as the line being continued.  A line continuation can only be performed where a separator is expected, like between a keyword name and its arguments or between two arguments or between a setting and its value(s). In the following example the two keyword calls are logically identical, even though the second one is split over three literal lines.  In documentation settings, line breaks with continuation are interpreted as a line break character. In Robot Framework documentation syntax, a single line break is treated as a space after interpretation, whereas two consecutive line breaks are considered a paragraph break. This allows you to structure documentation in a more readable and organized manner.  Example:  *** Settings *** Documentation This is the first paragraph of suite documentation. ... ... This is the second paragraph of suite documentation. Resource keywords.resource *** Test Cases *** Test Case Name [Documentation] This is the first paragraph of test documentation. ... ...

Hashes in the middle of a value are considered normal characters and do not need to be escaped.  If an argument value or any other token shall start with a hash (#) and is preceded by a separator (multiple spaces), the hash must be escaped by a backslash \\ like Click Element By Css \\#element_id.

Keywords can include arguments embedded directly into their names, a feature primarily used for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). Embedded arguments are mandatory and must be provided in the exact position defined within the keyword name.  Keyword names include arguments defined using the scalar variable syntax with dollar and curly braces (${var_name}). This syntax explicitly defines these as arguments, distinguishing them from the rest of the keyword name.  Example keyword names are:  &quot;${url}&quot; is openthe user clicks the &quot;${button}&quot; buttonthe page title should be ${exp_title}the url should be ${exp_url}  Example Test Case:  *** Test Cases *** Foundation Page should be Accessible Given &quot;robotframework.org&quot; is open When the user clicks the &quot;FOUNDATION&quot; button Then the page title should be Foundation | Robot Framework And the url should be https://robotframework.org/foundation   The optional prefixes Given, When, Then, And and But are basically ignored by Robot Framework if a keyword is found matching the rest of the name including the embedded arguments.

A special case of optional arguments that can only be set by their position are &quot;Variable Number of Positional Arguments&quot;. These are also referred to as *args or *varargs in Python. Some keywords need to collect a variable amount of values into one argument, because it is not possible to define the amount of values in advance.  One example for this kind of keyword is 2.5.1.2 Example Keyword Run Process from the Process library. This keyword executes a command with variable amount of arguments and waits for the process to finish. Depending on the command to be executed different amount of arguments are needed for that command.  This variable argument is marked with a single asterisk * before the argument name in the keyword documentation.  When calling this keyword, the first positional argument is assigned to command, while all subsequent positional arguments are collected into arguments. Because of this behavior, no additional positional arguments can be used after these &quot;Variable Number of Positional Arguments&quot;.

In this case all values given to the keyword as arguments, that do contain an unescaped equal sign (=) are considered as named arguments.  Free named arguments are marked with two asterisks ** before the argument name in the keyword documentation.  The example of the Run Process keyword also has a free named argument ** configuration.

Keywords may define the expected types of their argument values. The Robot Framework specification is predominantly a string-based language, therefore most statically defined argument values are strings. However, the actual implementation of the keyword may expect a different type of argument, like an integer.  If an argument type is defined and Robot Framework has a matching converter function available, that can convert the given type to the expected type, the conversion is tried automatically. If the conversion fails, the keyword call will fail with an error message before the actual keyword code is executed. Robot Framework brings some built-in converters for common types like integer, float, boolean, list, dictionary, etc. Library developers can also register their own converters for none-supported types.  Defining types for arguments is nowadays the recommended way to let Robot Framework convert the given arguments to the expected type, however it is optional.  Lets imagine a keyword that clicks on a specific coordinate on the screen, e.g. Click On Coordinates. This keyword would expect two integer arguments, one for the x-coordinate and one for the y-coordinate.  That keyword can now claim that it expects two integer arguments by defining type hints for these arguments. Type hints are shown in the keyword documentation at the arguments after the optional default value.  Robot Framework in that case tries to convert the given string arguments to the integer type.  Example:  *** Test Cases *** Test Conversion Click On Coordinates 10 20 # This will work Click On Coordinates 10 Not_A_Number # This will fail   In the first call the keyword will be called with the integer values 10 and 20 and will work as expected. The second keyword call will fail, because the second argument is not a number and cannot be converted to an integer. The error message would be: ValueError: Argument 'y' got value 'Not_A_Number' that cannot be converted to integer.  The advantage of using type hints is that the user get more information about what kind of values are expected and the keyword implementation can be simpler, because it can rely on the arguments being of the expected type.

If the keyword implementation offers a type hint for the return value, this is documented in the keyword documentation. Similar to the argument types, return types are optional and a more recent feature of Robot Framework and therefore not widely used, yet.

Keyword documentation is an important part of the keyword implementation. Good keyword names that clearly communicate what a keyword does are even more important, but this should not give the impression that descriptive documentation is unnecessary.  Documentation is sometimes lean and sometimes extensive, depending on the complexity of the keyword. The documentation should describe what the keyword does, how it should be used, and what the expected arguments and possible returned values are. Depending on the complexity it may also be useful to provide examples of how the keyword can be used.

Let's assume the following libraries and resource files shall be used:  Library ALibrary BLibrary Operating SystemResource tech_keywordsA.resourceResource tech_keywordsB.resourceResource variables.resourceResource functional_keywords.resource  The respective files could look like this:  tech_keywordsA.resource:  *** Settings *** Library A Library Operating System   tech_keywordsB.resource:  *** Settings *** Library B Resource variables.resource   functional_keywords.resource:  *** Settings *** Resource tech_keywordsA.resource Resource tech_keywordsB.resource   suite.robot:  *** Settings *** Resource functional_keywords.resource   In this case, the suite suite.robot has access to all keywords from all keyword libraries, as well as all variables and user keywords from all resource files. With this transitive importing it is possible to organize user keywords and imports of libraries in a hierarchical way.  It shall be avoided to create circular imports, where A.resource imports B.resource and B.resource imports A.resource.  It should be avoided to import the same library in different places multiple times. If the exact same library with the same configuration (see the next section) is imported again, it will be ignored because Robot Framework already has it in its catalog. However, if the library is imported with different configurations, it may be imported multiple times, but depending on the library’s internal behavior, the new configuration may have no effect on the existing keywords, or other side effects may occur.  Therefore, the recommendation is to import libraries only in one resource file with one configuration and use that import file in all places where the library is needed to make its keywords available.

Some libraries offer or need additional configuration to change their behavior or make them work. This is typically global behavior like internal timeouts, connection settings to systems, or plugins that should be used.  If this is possible, the library documentation will have an Importing section directly before the list of keywords.  Library importing arguments are used in the same way as keyword calls with arguments. If possible, it is recommended to set the arguments as named arguments to make usage more readable and future-proof. These arguments follow the Library path or name, separated by multiple spaces.  Example with the Telnet library:  *** Settings *** Library Telnet newline=LF encoding=ISO-8859-1 # set newline and encoding using named arguments   Another example that cannot be used without configuration is the Remote library. Remote libraries are libraries that are connected remotely via a network connection. So the actual library is running as a server, and the library Remoteis connecting as a client and connects the keywords of the server to Robot Framework. Therefore, it needs the server's address and port to connect to. Because there may be more than one Remote Library, we need to define the used library name as well.  *** Settings *** Library Remote uri=http://127.0.0.1:8270 AS EmbeddedAPI Library Remote uri=http://remote.devices.local:8270 AS DeviceAPI   In this example, two remote libraries are imported.

Naming conflicts can occur when two or more keywords have the same name. If a proper IDE is used, that can be detected, and users can be warned after they have created a duplicate user keyword name.  Project teams may not have this influence over imported third-party libraries that have the same keyword names. Due to the fact that keywords from library and resource files are imported in the scope of the importing suite, it may be unavoidable to have naming conflicts.  One example of these kinds of conflicts is the two librariesTelnetand SSHLibrary, which at the current time both have multiple keywords with the same name. This is because they both work with network connections and have similar functionality. Keywords like Open Connection, Login, Read, Close Connection, and many more are common.  These conflicts cannot be resolved by Robot Framework if they are coming from the same kind of source, like two libraries. The error message will be like this:  Multiple keywords with name 'Open Connection' found.

LO-3.3.5.3-2 Understand the role of embedded arguments in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) style.  In Robot Framework, embedded arguments allow the inclusion of arguments directly within the keyword name itself. This approach is particularly useful for creatingBehavior-Driven Development (BDD)-style test cases or for making keyword names more readable and meaningful.  With embedded arguments, placeholders are used within the keyword name, which are replaced by actual values when the keyword is executed. These arguments are written as scalar variables with dollar signs and curly braces, as shown in the following example:  *** Keywords *** The file '${file_name}' should contain '${expected_content}' ${file_content} = Get File ${file_name} Should Contain ${file_content} ${expected_content}   When this keyword is called, the placeholders ${file_name}and ${expected_content} are replaced by the actual values provided in the keyword call. For instance, in the following example,${file_name} is replaced with server.logand ${expected_content} with Successfully started:  *** Test Cases *** Test File Content Given the server log level is 'INFO' When the server is started successfully Then the file 'server.log' should contain 'Successfully started'   Quotes around the embedded arguments are treated as regular characters within the keyword name but can improve readability and help distinguish embedded arguments from the rest of the keyword name.  Embedded arguments can become problematic when the keyword name becomes overly long or complicated. To address this, a mix of embedded arguments and regular arguments can be used. This approach can help manage more complex data structures and enhance readability.  Example of mixed embedded and regular arguments:  *** Test Cases *** Embedded and normal arguments Given the user is on the pet selection page When the user adds 2 cat fish And the user sets 3 dogs And the user removes 1 dogs Then the number of cat fish should be 2 And the number of dogs should be count=2 *** Keywords *** the user is on the pet selection page Open Pet Selection Page the number of ${animals} should be [Arguments] ${count} ${current_count} Get Animal Count ${animals} Should Be Equal As Numbers ${current_count} ${count} the user ${action} [Arguments] ${amount} ${animal} IF '${action}' == 'adds' Add Items To List animal_list ${animal} ${amount} ELSE IF '${action}' == 'removes' Remove Items From List animal_list ${animal} ${amount} ELSE IF '${action}' == 'sets' Set Amount To List animal_list ${animal} ${amount} ELSE Skip Test skipped due to invalid action END   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"3.3.5.4 Other Argument Kinds​","type":1,"pageTitle":"3.3 User Keyword Definition & Arguments","url":"/robotframework-RFCP-syllabus/docs/chapter-03/user_keyword#3354-other-argument-kinds","content":" Other argument kinds like Named-Only Arguments, Free Named Arguments, orVariable Number of Positional Arguments should be known, but their definition and usage are not part of this syllabus.

LO-3.3.6-2 Use the RETURN statement to return values from a user keyword and assign it to a variable.  The RETURN statement (case-sensitive) in Robot Framework is used to return values from a User Keyword to be used in further test steps or stored in variables. This allows test execution to pass data between different keywords.  It can return one or more values. If more than one value is returned, they can either be assigned to multiple variables or stored as a list in a single variable.  Example:  *** Keywords *** Get File Name From Path [Arguments] ${file_path} ${path} ${file} = Split Path ${file_path} RETURN ${file}   The RETURN statement is normally used at the end of a keyword definition, because it will end the keyword execution at that point and return to the caller. However, this behavior can be used to conditionally end a keyword execution early together with an IF or TRY-EXCEPT statement.

(% for environment variables)Delimiter: {} to enclose the variable name.Variable Name: The string that addresses the variable. i.e. just the variable_name or more advanced access ways.  Variable names are case-insensitive and as keywords, containing single spaces and underscores are ignored when matching variable names. Robot Framework supports Unicode and allows the use of special characters and even Emojis in variable names.  In case these prefixes followed by a curly brace opening (${) should be used as characters in a normal string and not as a variable, they must be escaped by a backslash like \\${ to be treated as text rather than a variable start.  Robot Framework, implemented in Python, can work with any object stored in variables, and syntactically distinguishes four types of accessing variables:  Scalar Variables: Store values as a single entity and are represented by the dollar-syntax ${variable_name}.List Variables: Store multiple values in a list structure. They are created using the at-syntax @{list_variable_name}.Dictionary Variables: Store key-value pairs in a dictionary structure. They are created using the ampersand-syntax &amp;{dictionary_variable_name}.Environment Variables (read-only): Read access to environment variables of the operating system using the percent-syntax %{ENV_VAR_NAME}.  These different syntactical handling methods allow the users to also create and handle lists and dictionaries natively in Robot Framework. However, these prefixes just define the access type to the variable, and the actual data stored in the variable can be of any type, including strings, numbers, lists, dictionaries, or even objects.  When creating variables, different syntax is used to define the type of the variable as described in the next sections, but when accessing the variable, the scalar variable syntax with a dollar sign $ as the prefix is used in most cases.

They can only be created dynamically, so they have higher priority than suite or global variables while in scope. Once a test|task is finished, the variables are no longer available. If they have shadowed a suite or global variable, that variable returns to scope.  Recommendation: Test|Task variables should be used only when there is a clear need to share data across multiple keywords within a single test|task and when this is known by all team members. Otherwise, it is better to use local variables. Editor and IDE support for these variables is limited, so they should be used with caution.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"5.1.2.4 .

Usage: Commonly used to temporarily store data and pass it to other keywords.  Local variables are the most commonly used variables in Robot Framework and have the fewest side effects. They should be preferred over other variable scopes unless there is an explicit need to share data across scope boundaries.  Recommendation: Local variables should always be defined using lowercase letters, like ${local_variable}, to distinguish them from other variables.  Example of local variables:  *** Test Cases *** Test People In Room ${trainer_count} Get Trainers In Room # returns the integer 2 ${trainee_count} Get Trainees In Room # returns the integer 12 ${total_people} Calculate Sum ${trainer_count} ${trainee_count} Should Be Equal As Numbers ${total_people} 14 *** Keywords *** Calculate Sum [Arguments] ${num1} ${num2} ${result} Evaluate ${num1} + ${num2} RETURN ${result}   In this example, the variable ${trainer_count} is only available in the test case itself and not in the keyword Calculate Sum. Therefore, its value has to be passed as an argument to Calculate Sum, which assigns the value stored in ${trainer_count} to the local variable ${num1} within Calculate Sum. Additionally, ${result} is only available within Calculate Sum, and only its value is returned to the test case, where it is assigned to ${total_people}.

This allows you to perform the same actions for different items without duplicating code, enhancing the efficiency and readability of your keyword logic.  Robot Framework has four types of FOR loops; this chapter focuses on the basic FOR-IN loop.  FOR-IN is used to iterate over a list of values.  The other types are FOR-IN-RANGE, FOR-IN-ENUMERATE, and FOR-IN-ZIP, which are more advanced and less commonly required.  FOR-IN-RANGE iterates over a range of numbers.FOR-IN-ENUMERATE iterates over a list of values and their indexes.FOR-IN-ZIP iterates over multiple lists simultaneously.

This is typically used in cases where the number of iterations is not known in advance or depends on a dynamic condition.  One example use case would be scrolling down a page until a certain element is visible. In this case, you would use a WHILE loop to keep scrolling until the element is found or a maximum iteration limit is reached.  The WHILE loop begins with the WHILE token, followed by a condition that evaluates to true or false. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed, and the condition is re-evaluated. If the condition is false, the loop is exited, and execution continues with the next keyword after the END.

This can be achieved with the BREAK and CONTINUE statements.  BREAK stops the current loop and exits it immediately.CONTINUE skips the remaining part of the current iteration and continues with the next iteration.  These can, of course, be combined with IF statements to control the loop flow.  Example 1 BREAK:  Suppose we want to search for an element on a page and scroll down until it is visible. This time, we do not know the number of pages we can scroll, so we use the WHILE loop. However, we want the loop to iterate and BREAK once we have found the element.  Example with BREAK *** Test Cases *** Scroll Down Until Element Visible WHILE True # This would loop to the max iteration limit ${element_visible} Get Element Visibility &lt;locator&gt; IF ${element_visible} BREAK Scroll Down END   Here we used BREAK to exit the loop before scrolling down if the element is visible.
