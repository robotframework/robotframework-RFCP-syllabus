# Chapter 0: Course Overview

## About the Syllabus
This syllabus serves as the foundation for the "Robot Framework Certified Professional速" (RFCP) exam and training.
Its purpose is to outline the structure and learning objectives of the training course,
and it defines the knowledge a participant shall have to pass the exam.

The syllabus is divided into sections that progress logically from basic concepts to more advanced topics of Robot Framework.

The learning objectives (LOs) specified within this document are binding,
meaning they define the specific knowledge and skills participants are expected to acquire by the end of the course to pass the exam.
Additionally, the recommended sequence of topics in this syllabus helps guide the order of learning,
but the specific teaching methods, order and pace may be adapted by the instructor based on class dynamics or need.

## About "Robot Framework Certified Professional速"
The Robot Framework Certified Professional速 (RFCP) certification represents the foundational level of expertise in Robot Framework.
It focuses on providing participants with a solid understanding of the core principles and basic syntax required for developing effective automation scripts.

This certification is distinct from the future Robot Framework Certified Engineer速 (RFCE) certification, which targets more advanced users.
While RFCP covers essential concepts such as keyword-driven automation, script execution, and usage of external libraries, RFCE delves into more complex subjects like control structures, advanced variables, custom Python library development and more.
The RFCP is intended for those seeking proficiency in the core functionality of Robot Framework.

## Business Outcomes
Upon completing this course, participants will achieve the following capabilities:

- **Understand the architecture and mechanics of Robot Framework**: Gain a clear understanding of how Robot Framework operates, including its core components, execution flow, and interaction with external libraries.

- **Develop and maintain stable automation scripts**: Learn how to create automation scripts that are robust, easy to maintain, and adaptable to different scenarios.

- **Develop user keywords and build keyword repositories for reuse**: Understand how to create reusable keywords and build keyword repositories to improve efficiency and maintainability in automation projects.

- **Write documentation**: Learn best practices for documenting keywords, suites and tests or tasks to ensure clarity and ease of use for future script maintenance or collaboration.

- **Integrate external automation libraries**: Leverage external libraries to enable Robot Framework to interact with a wide range of technologies, such as APIs, user interfaces, databases, and more.

- **Understand the flow of more complex automation scripts**: Gain insights into how to structure and manage automation scripts that involve flow control, conditional executions or more intricate workflows.

- **Run automated executions**: Develop skills in executing automation tasks efficiently.

- **Understand, analyze, and debug automation results/protocols**: Learn how to interpret automation execution results, identify issues, and debug scripts effectively.

## About Learning Objectives and Knowledge Levels
The learning objectives (LOs) are a critical component of this syllabus,
as they define what participants are expected to know and be able to do by the end of the course.
To ensure a clear understanding of these objectives, we apply Knowledge Levels (K-Levels) as a framework for assessing learning progress.

- **K1 (Remember)**: Basic knowledge of terminology and facts. At this level, participants are expected to recall essential terms, concepts, and definitions.

- **K2 (Understand)**: Comprehension of concepts. Participants should demonstrate an understanding of the principles behind Robot Framework, such as its mechanics, syntax and architecture.

- **K3 (Apply)**: Practical application of knowledge. Participants are expected to be able to write and execute automation scripts, develop keywords, and interact with external libraries.

- **K4 (Analyze)**: Critical analysis and troubleshooting. At this level, participants will be able to analyze the execution of automation scripts, identify problems, and debug effectively.

<!-- TODO: The examples need better explaination. -->

Throughout the course, participants will progress through these knowledge levels, from basic recall (K1) to applying and analyzing automation tasks (K3, K4), ensuring a deep understanding of Robot Framework essentials.

## About Professional Training Providers

Professional Training Providers are organizations officially accredited by the Robot Framework Foundation to offer certified training programs.
These partners shall deliver high-quality, structured courses designed to prepare candidates for the Robot Framework Certified Professional (RFCP) exam and other future certifications.

All training providers are members of the Robot Framework Foundation,
and their training materials have been reviewed by independent Robot Framework Experts chosen by the Robot Framework Foundation to ensure the Foundation's quality standards.
Only these certified Professional Training Partners are permitted to refer to their courses as "Robot Framework" training or use the term "Robot Framework Certified Professional" in connection with their programs, due to the trademark on these terms.

Training can be exclusively pursued through these partners, but obtaining a certificate is not dependent on completing their courses, allowing flexibility for candidates to self-study if desired.

## About Exam Providers

Exam providers are independent organizations responsible for administering certification exams for the Robot Framework certification program.
These providers manage the entire examination process, from scheduling and conducting the exams to handling participant data and maintaining certification records.

An exam provider ensures that the certification process is handled professionally and securely.
They are tasked with delivering a seamless exam experience, including remote proctoring services, technical support, and other logistical elements.
In addition to overseeing the exam itself, they maintain strict confidentiality and compliance with data privacy regulations, ensuring the secure management of all participant information.

The exam provider is also responsible for storing and managing certification data.
This includes tracking which participants have earned certifications, maintaining certification validity, and providing verification services if needed.
